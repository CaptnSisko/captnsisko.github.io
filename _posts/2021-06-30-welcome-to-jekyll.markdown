Hello World! I am not sure whether anyone will read these, but since you are here now... hello!

When creating this website, I was considering creating some fancy animation in three.js or having some complex continuous integration with AWS Cloudfront. Realistically, though, a simple Github pages site is much easier for me to maintain. Besides, it would be kind of egotistical to spend a long time on a portfolio site instead of writing code that is actually useful.

Will I remember to write posts here? Probably not. I think there will be gaps where I am too busy with school and/or work to bother updating this site much. Sorry.

Anyways, here's some fun hello world programs, complete with syntax highlighting. The following code may contain typos, so use it at your own risk.

Ruby:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi()
  puts "Hello World"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Python:
{% highlight python %}
def print_hi():
  print('Hello World')
{% endhighlight %}

Javascript:
{% highlight javascript %}
function print_hi() {
  console.log('Hello World');
}
{% endhighlight %}

Java:
{% highlight java %}
public static void print_hi() {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
{% endhighlight %}

C++:
{% highlight cpp %}
void print_hi() {
  std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}
